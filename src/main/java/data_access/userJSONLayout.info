Here's an overview of how the data is laid out in the API:
All of these are within the "info" JSON object in the JSON returned by the API.

Course:
"type": "course"  - This describes whether this is a user or course. Common between all API users for our application
"courseData"      - A JSON Object unique to courses.
    "instructors"   - A JSON Array storing the names of all instructors of this course (in Strings)
    "students"      - Similar to instructors, but for students. A JSON Array storing the names of all students.
    "latePolicy"    - A String describing this course's late submission policy.
    "assignments"   - A JSON Object storing all of the assignments for this course.
                        All entries within this object will themselves be objects, whose name represents the
                        assignment name, and whose data is associated with that assignment.
        "exampleAssignmentName" - A JSON Object representing an assignment in this course.
            "description"   - A String describing this assignment
            "creationDate"  - A String representing when this assignment was created
            "dueDate"       - A String representing when this assignment is due
            "gradePeriod"   - A String holding an integer value, specifies how many minutes late submissions are accepted.
            "supportedFileTypes"    - A JSON Array storing the file types this assignment supports.
                                        If any file type is supported, we can leave the array empty?
            "submissions"   - A JSON Object storing all of the submissions for this assignment.
                                All entries within this object will themselves be objects, whose name represents the
                                submitting student's name, and whose data is associated with that submission.
                "exampleStudentName"    - A JSON Object representing a submission to this assignment.
                    "submittedAt"   - A String representing when this submission was published.
                    "fileName"      - A String holding the name of the file submitted.
                    "fileData"      - A String holding the data of the file submitted.
                    "status"        - A String representing the status of this submission.
                                        One of: "ON_TIME", "LATE", "GRADED", or "UNDER_REVIEW".
                    "grade"         - A String holding a double value representing the grade of this assignment.
                                        If the status of this submission isn't GRADED or UNDER_REVIEW, the value
                                        of this string shouldn't be trusted. That is, the program should never
                                        use it. That said, I think we should have it set to "-1.0" to be safe.
                    "feedback"      - A String holding any feedback left by the instructor for this submission.
                                        Again, if the status isn't GRADED or UNDER_REVIEW, the value of this string
                                        shouldn't be used. That said, it makes sense to have it be an empty string
                                        if no feedback has been left.

User:
"type"      - This describes whether this is a user or course. Common between all API users for our application
                For a user, this should either be "student" or "instructor", depending on the user type.
"userData"  - A JSON Object unique to users.
    "firstName" - A String representing this user's first name
    "lastName"  - A String representing this user's last name
    "courses"   - A JSON Array storing the course codes of all courses this user has access to (enrolled in / teaches)
